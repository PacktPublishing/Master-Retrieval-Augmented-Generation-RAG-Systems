# Master Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems
This is the code repository for Master Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems, published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.


This course offers an in-depth exploration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. You’ll start with the basics, progress through advanced techniques, and engage in hands-on sessions to reinforce learning. By the end, you’ll have a solid grasp of how to implement and optimize RAG systems.

### What will you learn?

Implement naive and advanced RAG techniques  
Optimize document retrieval and answer generation  
Apply query expansion with multiple queries  
Utilize cross-encoder and bi-encoder re-ranking  
Perform dense passage retrieval effectively  
Integrate advanced RAG techniques into AI applications
